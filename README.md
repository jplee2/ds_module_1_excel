# Bootcamp Homework for Module 1 - Excel

For this project, I analyzed a dataset of kickstarter projects.

I demonstrated the basics of data cleaning by changing the formats of several date columns, creating two new category columns using the TEXTSPLIT function, and by making a new column that calculated the percent funded for projects. I then applied conditional formatting to help make the raw datasheet more readable. 

I created a few different data visualizations that modeled the success of these projects by category, sub-category, month, and the size of the funding goals.

I also performed some statistical analysis after separating the projects out by failure or success and examined the shape of the data. I found that there was a higher variance with successful projects and that both are heavily influenced by the presence of outliers.
